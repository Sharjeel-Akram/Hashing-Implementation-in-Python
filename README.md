# Hashing-Implementation-in-Python

1. Write a program to insert integers in the range of 1 and 10000. Total number of elements which can possibly be needed to store in hash table are around 300. Your program needs to show number of steps required to insert 300 randomly generated numbers in the hash table using:

- Linear Probing
- Quadratic Probing
- Double Hashing
- Separate Chaining
Both hash functions need to be designed by yourselves individually. You need to choose sizeof hash table carefully. Your task is to optimize the functions such that number of probes are sufficiently reduced closer to O (1).
